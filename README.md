# phoneautomationgui

The purpose of this project was to build a GUI to allow a company the ability to automate sending bulk emails to thier clients. So if a company had 50 clients they met with on Monday, this would automate their emails for them. It has the capabilities to add and remove clients, and tailor a personalized message to the clients. 


### Future addons:
  - Allow for choosing between email and text
  - Allow for companies to choose their own theme for pysimplegui
